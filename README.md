The source code here is provided for educational purposes. It is not recommended to run your own instance of this bot, and no support will be given for you to do so. Instead use the invite slash command or the "Add to Server" button on the bot's profile.

## Contributing

We're open to contributions. However, make an issue first if you want to contribute to the bot as the code is convoluted in areas and may not be easily understood.
